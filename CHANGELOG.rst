  difficulty and character attribute (strength, perception, intelligence,
  constitution). If they don't exist, the labels are created automatically.

-----------------------------------------

* Added pet feeding function to pet care plugin.
* Trello cards that are both new and completed are now synchronised to Habitica
  if their last update time is more recent than the last synchronisation.

    * `sb-health` instead of `scriptabit --run health_effects`

1.10.0 (2016-08-30)
-----------------------------------------

* Made plugin update more robust. Exceptions are caught so that updates can
  continue rather than aborting the whole run.
* Implemented simple health drain and regeneration in health effects plugin.

  during the last pet.

  (`SCRIPTABIT_LOGGING_CONFIG`). Log statement with the location of the user
  plugin directory.

  information.

1.14.0 (2016-12-09)
-----------------------------------------

* Added spellcast plugin

1.14.1 (2016-12-21)
-----------------------------------------

* Added HP preservation option to spellcast plugin. This allows casting Blessing
  spells that don't heal the player.

1.15.0 (2016-12-22)
-----------------------------------------

* Adding increment functions for XP, MP, HP. I already have direct set functions
  but the new ones are easier when you just want to increment the values up or
  down.
* Expanding the banking feature to allow mana and health banks as well as gold.
* Removed the bank name option, as it made supporting different bank types more
  complicated.

1.16.0 (sometime in January 2017)
---------------------------------

* New tasks plugin. Run with ``sb-tasks``.
* Added minimum requests version to setup.py.
* Added entry point for spellcasting plugin ``sb-cast``.
* Cleaned up argument parsing, so running a plugin entry-point with the --help
  argument only shows help for that plugin.
* Running ``scriptabit --help`` now only shows help for the main application
  rather than all possible args from all plugins.
* Added documentation for spell casting.
* Added fallback help display so that plugins that fail to define a ``print_help``
  function will use the default help display.

1.17.0 (Monday January 16, 2017)
--------------------------------

* Changed pet_care logic so it detects quest and magic pets implicitly. This
  means I don't need to manually update the code for new quest or magic pets.
* Added tag management features to ``sb-tasks``. You can now list tags, list
  unused tags, and delete unused tags. I didn't add a function to delete a tag
  by name as this is trivial to do in the web app.
* Fixed the issue in 1.16.0 where plugin names would log as "None".
* Added sample task CSV file showing the required layout for ``sb-csv``
* Updated documentation for pet care and tasks.

1.17.2 (Tuesday January 17, 2017)
---------------------------------

* Very minor changes to PyPI metadata and README file.
* Made the update and creation of the notification panel optional. Use the
  `use-notification-panel` command line argument to control the behaviour.
* Made the task tags configurable. Use the ``--tags`` argument to pass a comma
  separated list of tags that will be used with any task created in Habitica. If
  you use ``--tags ""`` then no tags will be created or applied.

1.18.0 (Monday January 23, 2017)
--------------------------------

* Implemented character level set and increment/decrement.

2.0.0 (Monday January 30, 2017)
-------------------------------

* Bumped to major version 2 because of the breaking change in Trello sync.
* Fixed issues in trello sync. Unfortunately they require a complete reset of
  sync data. See the README.rst for details.
* CSV task uploader now recognizes "difficulty" as a column header, as well as
  "priority". Documentation changed to document "difficulty", as "priority" is
  deprecated and only preserved for backwards compatibility.
* Added scaling option for basic user stats.
* Added option to prevent pet raising to mounts during batch feeding.

2.0.1 (Wednesday February 01, 2017)
-----------------------------------

* Fixed issue #44: no-raise option not working for pet feeding.
* Fixed issue #47: bad request caused by attempting to hatch a magic quest pet
  (this is an invalid combination).
* Fixed code for breaking API change in bidict (yes, another one).

2.1.1 (Tuesday April 17, 2018)
----------------------------------

* Added code to prevent the attempt to delete tasks that belong to a challenge.
